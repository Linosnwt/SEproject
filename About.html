    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <h3>If you want to know more about me, here we are!</h3>
    <p>
    
        My name is <b>Linoskossi nouwoto</b>. I am a graduate <br>of <b>african institut
        of administration and business studies (IAEC Togo)</b>, <br>with a Bachelor
        degree in marketing.<br>
        i am  currently a teacher at <b>Peniel Glory preparatory</b><br> School. i have 
        been teaching there for a year now.I teach class one and <br>class two.<br>
        I am also a student at <b>Aitti-Kace sunyani</b>. i am studying <br>computer
        science. Majore in networking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Linos</b> always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo<br> who wrote 
        "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote <br>"John Christopher". 
        They have influenced millions of people through their <br>books. I also 
        wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or <br>Sigmund Freud,
         who could read peopleâ€™s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close <br>to these people, 
         yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, <br>and some 
         writing. But my dream is still alive.
